How to play the game
++++++++++++++++++++

1) Download all files into a folder, say "2014_game." There are 20 files altogether including this README file. For the comprehensive list of the files, please see "All Files.jpeg" in the "Screenshots" folder.

2) "cd" into the "2014_game" folder. You may need to "sudo su" to invoke superuser privileges to play the game.

3) Simply run "make" to invoke the game on a Linux terminal.

Note
****

All new seeds are in burnt orange color.

The game will proportionally augment the game board in response to larger numbers.

Running "make" would suffice to invoke the game to play; however, you may often want to run "make clean" to clean up your files a bit.

Beware of running "make clean," which will "WIPE AWAY" the "Best Score" of the game. The "Best Score" is defined to be the best score to date.

Simply running "make" WON'T "WIPE AWAY" the "Best Score."

+++++++++++++
Miscellaneous 
+++++++++++++

The folder "Screenshots" contains 3 JPEG files. If you are invoking the game correctly, you should see the contents of these JPEG files on your Linux terminal.
